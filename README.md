# Valentine Proposal Website 💖

This is a simple and interactive **Valentine's Day web page** to ask someone special to be your Valentine. Hosted using **GitHub Pages**.

## 🎨 Features

- Cute **"Will You Be My Valentine?"** message.
- **Yes** button shows a lovely confirmation message, hides the buttons and original message, displays a cute GIF, and plays background music.
- **No** button moves away when hovered over or clicked (so they can't say no! 😆).
- Styled with **CSS** for a romantic look.
